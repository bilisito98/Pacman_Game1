PACMAN:
Pac-Man is an iconic arcade video game created by Japanese video game designer
Toru Iwatani and released by Namco in 1980. The game quickly became a cultural 
phenomenon and is one of the most recognized and beloved games in the history of video games.

In Pac-Man, the player controls a round, yellow character named Pac-Man, who has to eat all the dots scattered around a maze while
avoiding being trapped by four ghosts, each with their own unique behavior. In addition to the normal dots, there are larger dots known as 
"power pills" that allow Pac-Man to become temporarily invincible and able to devour the ghosts, which temporarily turns them into prey.

The object of the game is to clear each maze of dots while avoiding the ghosts. Each time Pac-Man eats all the dots in a level, he moves on to 
the next level, where the dots become harder to reach and the ghosts become more aggressive.

Pac-Man became a cultural phenomenon, spawning a series of sequels, adaptations and spin-offs on various gaming platforms and 
entertainment media. It has been the subject of multiple academic studies and has influenced popular culture significantly since its release.
